#### Notes from 2020/03/17
I did can open, compile and run the solution under Visual Studio Community 2019
which is very nice

But when I update the connection strings to attach ASPNET DB and QUESTIONNAIRE DB 
to SqlLocalDB server the message from the application was :

**The user instance login flag is not supported on this version of SQL Server. The connection will be closed.**

Which is less and less nice because for now i don't know what to do with.
